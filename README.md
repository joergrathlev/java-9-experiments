# Java 9 in Vagrant

Installation:

- Download [JDK 9 Early Access](https://jdk9.java.net/jigsaw/) for Linux (64 bit) and [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi), place the `tar.gz` files in the project root.
- Edit the `Vagrantfile` so that the file names of the JDK and Maven downloads match the versions you haven downloaded in the previous step.
- Run `vagrant up`.
